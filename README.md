 <summary><h3>About Me</h3></summary>
  I have always had an interest in understanding how things work and finding ways to improve them. It was only natural that I was drawn to software engineering, where I can use my passion for problem-solving to develop elegant solutions that benefit individuals and organizations. I fell in love with the process of breaking down problems, finding and implementing solutions through code. My curiosity for how things work and how they can be improved drives me to constantly explore new ideas and solutions. 

I am currently gaining hands-on experience in multiple programming languages and software development principles through my studies at Coyotiv School of Software Engineering. Additionally, my experience in UX/UI design and  past degree in Business Administration has allowed me to approach software engineering from both a technical and a user-centered perspective.

I have  experience working on real course project using technologies like Javascript, HTML, CSS, Node.js, Vue.js, MongoDB, Docker and  also have experience deploying to cloud services such as Google Cloud Run.  

I am excited to continue learning and growing in the field and I am eager to bring my skills, experience, and passion to a company as a Junior Software Engineer and to work alongside experienced professionals to create innovative software solutions that drive business success.
